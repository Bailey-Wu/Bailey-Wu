| Rururuur           | R U R' U R U2 R'                      | Yellow Fish to Face |
| Lurulur            | L' U R U' L U R'+ R U R' U R U2 R'    | Yellow Corners |
| Clockwise          | F2 U R' L F2 L' R U F2                | Position Yellow Edges CW|
| Counter-Clockwise  | F2 U' R' L F2 L' R U' F2              | Position Yellow Edges CCW|

<b> 1. Yellow Daisy </b>

<b> 2. White Cross </b>
</br> Make sure to match with centered faces

<b> 3. Solve Bottom Layer </b>
</br> If White sticker is on the side of Top layer, identify the color sticker to the side of the white sticker and rotate the top layer until that color is diagonal to the color of center face. That face will be facing toward the user. 
- If it is diagonally LEFT perform <b>LEFT</b> Trigger (L' U' L) = (Left_Up Top_Right Left_Down)
- If it is diagonally RIGHT perform <b>RIGHT</b> Trigger (R U R') = (Right_Up Top_Left Right_Down)

<b> Unusual Situations </b> 
- White piece is on the bottom layer: Move it to the top you idiot
- White piece is on face of the top layer: Rotate top layer until it is directly above the opposite of non-white sticker of bottom cube. If the white piece is left of the yellow center sticker, perform "Left Trigger" twice. If it is to the right of the yellow sticker, perform "Right Trigger" twice.
- This step should move the white sticker to the side and now perform diagonally align + trigger

<b> 4. Solve Second Layer </b>
</br> The centers should be solved already if the White Cross step was done correctly. Focusing on the edges of the second layer
- Look for edges on top layer with no yellow pieces, rotate the top layer to make a upside down T and decide if the edge needs to go left or right
  - If right, turn the top layer toward you with your right finger and perform right trigger (U R U R')
  - If left, turn the top layer toward you with your left finger and perform left trigger (U' L' U' L)
</br> The edge piece of the top layer should now be on the second layer
- This step might move the white sticker to the side and now perform diagonally align + trigger
<b> Unusual Situations </b> 
- Edges on top layer all have yellow pieces: pull it out using Trigger + Diagonally Trigger

<b> 5. Yellow Cross </b>
</br> F U R U' R' F'
- Focusing on Yellow Edge Pieces: Perform FURU'R'F' until you get yellow edge pieces
- If Yellow Straight Line, orientate the cube so you see the yellow line vertically on top. Then perform FURU'R'F'
- If Yellow L, orientate the cube so you see a backwards "L" (9 & 12 o'clock positions). Then perform FURU'R'F'

Should now have yellow cross

<b> 6. Solve entire yellow face </b>
- Focusing on Yellow Corner Pieces
- If 0 or 2 Yellow Corner Pieces, Rotate top layer until yellow sticker is on the upper right hand corner of the Left Side
  - Perform R U R' U R U2 R'
  - Repeat until you get the Yellow Fish
- If 1 Yellow Corner Piece (Yellow Fish), rotate the Yellow corner piece to the lower left of top layer so the mouth of the fish points Southwest
  - Perform R U R' U R U2 R'  
  - If you get the yellow fish again, repeat as needed. 

<b> 7. Position the Corners </b>
</br> L' U R U' L U R'R U R' U R U2 R'
</br> or
</br> L' U R U' L U U R' U R U2 R' 
</br> L' U R U' L U2 R' U R U2 R' 
- If the no corner pieces of a side match colors, perform the above algorithm
  - L' U R U' L U R'R U R' U R U2 R'
- If the corner pieces of a side match colors, then hold that side with the left hand and perform the above algorithm
  - L' U R U' L U R'R U R' U R U2 R'

<b> 8. Position the Edges </b>
- If one side is completely solved, face that side away from you and decide if the edges need to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise:
  - If clockwise: F2 U R' L F2 L' R U F2
  - If counterclockwise: F2 U' R' L F2 L' R U' F2
  - Only U's are reversed
- If no side is completely solved (all edges are different), use perform one of the clockwise/counterclockwise and then repeat the previous
  - Make sure to face the side that is completed away from you and then perform clockwise or counterclockwise
