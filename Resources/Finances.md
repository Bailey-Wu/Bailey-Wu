## Move your HSA from HealthEquity to Fidelity

Must least at least $25 in HE - that is the account minimum

https://member.my.healthequity.com/helpcenter/form-transfer request partial transfer from HE

To initiate transfer from Fidelity use this link: https://digital.fidelity.com/ftgw/digital/transfer-of-assets/

It will take 2-3 weeks for the funds to be transferred. No idea why it takes that long in this era, but it is what it is.

You will need your account number for the company that you are not initiating the request from, and if initiating from Fidelity you will need a statement from HE showing the current balance (you can download a statement at any time showing the current balance, no need to wait for the end of the month and a regular monthly statement).

**You don't even have to be separated from Boeing to move money out of health equity. Their investments options are garbage compared to fidelity - just open a fidelity HSA and transfer funds every few months.
