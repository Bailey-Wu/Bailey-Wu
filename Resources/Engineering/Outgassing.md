## Outgassing

Outgassing, the release of gases from materials in a vacuum, is crucial in space because it can contaminate sensitive instruments and surfaces, leading to damage and mission failure. Preventing or minimizing outgassing is essential for the reliable operation of spacecraft, especially those with optics, sensors, and thermal control systems

### Why outgassing is important in space:

<b> Contamination of Sensitive Instruments: </b>
Outgassed molecules can condense on surfaces, creating thin films that can degrade the performance of optical instruments, detectors, and other sensitive components. 

For example, the Cassini Space Probe experienced outgassing that coated its main camera, reducing image quality.

<b> Damage to Optical and Sensor Surfaces: </b>
Condensates formed by outgassing can obscure or degrade optical surfaces, making them less effective for imaging and scientific measurements.

<b> Bake-Out Procedures: </b>
To mitigate outgassing, spacecraft designers often employ bake-out procedures, which involve heating the spacecraft under vacuum conditions to drive off trapped gases before launch.

<b> NASA Standards and Testing: </b>
NASA and other space agencies have established standards and testing methods, such as ASTM E595, to evaluate the outgassing performance of materials and ensure they are suitable for use in space.
