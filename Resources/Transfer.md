# EIS 

Below are strong, experienced-level bullet points tailored for a Tooling Design Engineer in a production environment like Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

They emphasize factory support, technical depth, ownership, and production impact — which align well with a Retention Index / Redeployment review.

⸻

COMPETENCY BASED RELEVANT SKILLS

⸻

Asset Support

• Provide direct factory-floor support for production tooling and equipment, ensuring rapid resolution of non-conformances, minimizing downtime, and maintaining schedule adherence for active aircraft programs.

• Lead preventative maintenance planning, spares identification, and lifecycle management strategies to improve asset reliability and reduce total cost of ownership.

• Investigate and disposition tooling discrepancies through root cause analysis, coordinating with Manufacturing, Quality, and Supplier teams to maintain configuration integrity and production readiness.

⸻

Design Safe and Reliable Assets

• Develop tooling concepts and detailed designs that comply with structural, ergonomic, and safety requirements, incorporating factors such as load paths, factor of safety, human interface risks, and maintainability.

• Conduct engineering analysis (hand calculations and FEA where applicable) to validate structural integrity and functional performance of fixtures, jigs, lifting devices, and automation support equipment.

• Ensure compliance with regulatory, environmental, and internal safety standards by integrating hazard assessments and risk mitigation strategies early in the design phase.

⸻

Mechanical Component & System Engineering

• Design and integrate mechanical systems including structural weldments, precision alignment features, actuation mechanisms, and modular tooling assemblies to support aircraft build requirements.

• Apply GD&T principles and tolerance stack-up analysis to ensure tooling interfaces correctly with aircraft structure and meets production accuracy requirements.

• Collaborate with Product and Manufacturing Engineering to optimize tool-to-aircraft interfaces, ensuring producibility, repeatability, and system-level performance across programs.

⸻

Requirements

• Develop and translate production system requirements into detailed engineering data packages including design definitions, usage instructions, procurement specifications, and acceptance criteria.

• Lead gated design reviews to ensure tooling solutions meet safety, functional, schedule, and cost requirements prior to release and fabrication.

• Validate supplier compliance with contractual and technical requirements, supporting make/buy decisions and managing external design work packages.

⸻

Troubleshooting

• Lead root cause investigations for tooling failures, dimensional escapes, or integration issues, implementing corrective actions to prevent recurrence and maintain production flow.

• Support tool try-outs and first-article validations, identifying performance gaps and driving rapid design refinements to meet operational requirements.

• Troubleshoot mechanical and integration issues in collaboration with cross-functional teams, applying structured problem-solving methodologies to resolve complex production constraints.

⸻

If you’d like, I can also:
	•	Make this more impact-driven with quantified results
	•	Tailor it more specifically to automation/robotics-heavy roles
	•	Adjust tone to sound more strategic (senior-level) or more technical-depth focused
	•	Align it to internal Boeing competency language if you share it

Let me know your years of experience and whether this is for lateral redeployment or retention justification.

# Message to Jeramy

Hi Jeramy, thank you for sending me these resources. 
I scheduled a meeting next Tuesday to review my resume. I'd like some feedback on how to tailor it to some specific roles (Design, Process, Product Management). Here are some example of recs that I'm interested in applying. 

Looking forward to our meeting next week
Thanks,
Bailey

# Message to Anita

I’m meeting with someone to talk about their career perspective about companies and industries around the area of North Carolina and I made a guide of the companies I’ve researched and to become more familiar with the industries around the area. Can you help me draft an email that shares the guide with them just as a preface / provide context before our call? Here is a quick message I drafted up but feel free to change any wording around: 

‘Hi Anita, 

I’ve done some research on the companies in the area of North Carolina and made this guide. 

I wanted to send it to you before our call to see if you had any opinions on the the companies and industries around the area. Some other topics I’m interested in hearing your  as well as your transition from Aerospace to MedTech 

Looking forward to our chat! 

Best,
Brian

	•	How would you describe the overall business and industry landscape in North Carolina?
	•	What industries do you think are especially strong or gaining momentum in this area right now?
	•	When people think about careers in North Carolina, what do you think they often overlook?

⸻

Companies & industries (tie directly to your guide)

These show you did your homework and invite their insight.
	•	Are there any companies or industries in my guide that stand out to you—either positively or negatively?
	•	Are there companies here that don’t get much attention but are actually great places to build a career?
	•	Which industries here feel more stable long-term versus more cyclical or volatile?
