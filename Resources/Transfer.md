Why BD? 
Common Questions: 
“Why are you interested in this role?”
“What attracted you to our company?”
“What are you looking for next?” 
-	Talk about similar missions between my aerospace projects and MedTech devices – how both industries focus on saving peoples lives and the consequences for when things go wrong so it’s important to get things right 
-	Yeah that’s a good question – I’d say I’ve talked to people in the MedTech industry and it seems like there’s a similar sense of pride I get with the aerospace products I’ve worked on  
-	Yeah that’s a good question, I’d say there’s a lot of reasons I’m interested in working for BD but one of the reasons I’ll mention is that I’ve talked to people in the Medical Device Industry and it seems like there’s a similar sense of pride I get with the aerospace products I’ve worked on  -- like whenever I fly
o	Pride
o	Margins of Error
o	High Stakes High Reward


My Fit for BD
-	I come from an Aerospace background and after speaking to a few people in the MedTech industry, I’ve realized there are a lot of parallel processes when it comes to requirements, regulatory bodies, process control 
-	Sensitive Products in Cleanroom environment
-	Material Trade Off Decisions & Testing
-	So what I plan to bring to BD is my background with Materials & Process Engineering but also the design and analysis skills I’ve gained from other roles. 

Extensive experience with testing from the aerospace industry 

Experience in Materials & Process seems to be the most translatable to Materials Testing role but the CAD and Tooling adds to the design aspect of the role

# Message to Jeramy

Hi Jeramy, thank you for sending me these resources. 
I scheduled a meeting next Tuesday to review my resume. I'd like some feedback on how to tailor it to some specific roles (Design, Process, Product Management). Here are some example of recs that I'm interested in applying. 

Looking forward to our meeting next week
Thanks,
Bailey

# Message to Anita

I’m meeting with someone to talk about their career perspective about companies and industries around the area of North Carolina and I made a guide of the companies I’ve researched and to become more familiar with the industries around the area. Can you help me draft an email that shares the guide with them just as a preface / provide context before our call? Here is a quick message I drafted up but feel free to change any wording around: 

‘Hi Anita, 

I’ve done some research on the companies in the area of North Carolina and made this guide. 

I wanted to send it to you before our call to see if you had any opinions on the the companies and industries around the area. Some other topics I’m interested in hearing your  as well as your transition from Aerospace to MedTech 

Looking forward to our chat! 

Best,
Brian

Big-picture perspective (great openers)

These help you understand how they frame the region.
	•	How would you describe the overall business and industry landscape in North Carolina?
	•	What industries do you think are especially strong or gaining momentum in this area right now?
