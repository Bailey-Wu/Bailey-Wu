# Message to Jeramy

Hi Jeramy, thank you for sending me these resources. 
I scheduled a meeting next Tuesday to review my resume. I'd like some feedback on how to tailor it to some specific roles (Design, Process, Product Management). Here are some example of recs that I'm interested in applying. 

Looking forward to our meeting next week
Thanks,
Bailey

# Message to Anita

I’m meeting with someone to talk about their career perspective about companies and industries around the area of North Carolina and I made a guide of the companies I’ve researched and to become more familiar with the industries around the area. Can you help me draft an email that shares the guide with them just as a preface / provide context before our call? Here is a quick message I drafted up but feel free to change any wording around: 

‘Hi Anita, 

I’ve done some research on the companies in the area of North Carolina and made this guide. 

I wanted to send it to you before our call to see if you had any opinions on the the companies and industries around the area. Some other topics I’m interested in hearing your  as well as your transition from Aerospace to MedTech 

Looking forward to our chat! 

Best,
Brian

Big-picture perspective (great openers)

These help you understand how they frame the region.
	•	How would you describe the overall business and industry landscape in North Carolina?
	•	What industries do you think are especially strong or gaining momentum in this area right now?
	•	When people think about careers in North Carolina, what do you think they often overlook?

⸻

Companies & industries (tie directly to your guide)

These show you did your homework and invite their insight.
	•	Are there any companies or industries in my guide that stand out to you—either positively or negatively?
	•	Are there companies here that don’t get much attention but are actually great places to build a career?
	•	Which industries here feel more stable long-term versus more cyclical or volatile?
