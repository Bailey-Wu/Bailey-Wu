“Why did you move to Seattle?”

That’s a question I’ve gotten a lot in the past year.
People usually ask if was for work, or for school
But the truth is – I moved because I was feeling stuck
I was feeling stuck doing the same routine and living a life that felt slow --
And the issue was that  – I was feeling stuck in one of the most beautiful places in California.
And I had so many privileges of having a stable life with friends and family –
But there was this itch I always felt – of exploring a new place
As Hercules mentioned before going the distance, “I gotta know”
I wanted to know what it felt like to start new again
I wanted that feeling of exploring and … discovering a new community
So far
But I also learned that moving isn’t always joy – I didn’t understand what I sacrificed:
Like the friendships I built, relying on the blue line in the navigation app, having to find a new barber, not going into a restaurant where they know your order.


But I’m proud to say that this move has made me a stronger person
So far, I’ve met some really cool people
I’ve gotten to experience

So that’s what I really want to say when someone asks me “Why did you move?”
But for the sake of time, I just say “it was time for a life change”
