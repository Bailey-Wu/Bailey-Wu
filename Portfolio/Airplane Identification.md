## Purpose ✈️
With the large variety of airliners serving the worldwide transportation market today, identification of individual aircraft manufacturers and planes can be a bit tricky. After spending some time working for an airplane manufacturer, I thought it’d be helpful to share some of the tricks I've learned and put together a quick guide to easily identify commercial airplanes.

## Categorizing Airplanes
There are tons of commercial airplanes in the sky, but to keep things simple, we’ll focus on just two types: Narrow-Body and Wide-Body jets.

Check out this table showcasing examples of each type of plane from Airbus, Boeing, and other manufacturers:

## Features of an Airplane
To spot a specific plane, it’s important to get familiar with the terminology related to different airplane features.

## Distinct Features
Some airplanes have unique features that help distinguish them from others. Here are a few examples:

### Different Nose Shapes

### 737 Next Generation "Scimitar" Winglets

Here is a spreadsheet in my best attempt to compile airplanes and their features 

## Fleet Analysis
Another way to identify a plane is by getting to know the fleets of different airliners, as each airline company has a diverse range of commercial aircraft that contribute to their fleet size.

This chart shows you which airlines prefer Airbus, which ones lean towards Boeing, and which have a balanced mix of both.
