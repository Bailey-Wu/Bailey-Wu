##  :beginner: About
Disclaimer: I want to clarify that I am not a personal trainer. With the vast amount of information available on workout regimes, I often felt overwhelmed trying to determine my fitness goals and which exercises would be most beneficial for me. This is why I decided to create a personalized space to share my own experiences and insights, as they may resonate with others navigating similar challenges.

## :zap: Defining Motivation
The first important step I took was reflecting on my motivations for working out. I identified my main reasons for my fitness journey:
-  To run faster and jump higher, enabling me to compete at higher levels of Ultimate Frisbee
-  To build strength and reduce the risk of injuries
-  To cultivate healthy habits that will benefit me as I age

    id8(Run Faster)--> id10(Become a better Ultimate Frisbee Player);
    id9(Throw Better)--> id10(Become a better Ultimate Frisbee Player);
```
By clearly outlining my motivations, I was able to understand the underlying reasons for my workouts and create a comprehensive vision that would guide my fitness routine.

##  :clock1: Routine
The next step I took was to assess how I could incorporate working out into my daily life and how frequently I was committed to adding exercise into my schedule.

| Day       | Activity        |
|-----------|------------------|
| Monday    | Upper Body                  |
| Tuesday   | Frisbee / Cardio                 |
| Wednesday | Abs                 |
| Thursday  | Lower Body                 |
| Friday    | Recovery Day                 |
| Saturday  | Frisbee / Cardio                 |
| Sunday    | Floater                 |

I believe it's perfectly fine to adjust the plan when life events arise. However, creating this routine provided me with a clear understanding of how much time I was willing to commit to working out. Additionally, incorporating a "Floater" Day allowed me to shift my schedule as needed for any unexpected events.

##  :wrench: Equipment
The next step was to assess the workout equipment I had at my disposal: Did I have any home equipment? Access to a gym? Free weights? I ultimately decided to get a gym membership near my workplace, allowing me to go there after work and bypass the post-work traffic.

##  :nut_and_bolt: Workout
Once I established my time and equipment, I wanted to understand how I would structure my workouts. I decided to set two gym days: 1 for Upper Body and 1 for Lower Body. Then the Abs and Cardio days I can do at home or outside the gym. 

### :nut_and_bolt: Upper Body
Based on what I've found, a good upper body workout involves working the following muscle groups
-  Chest: 2 exercises
-  Back: 2 exercises
-  Shoulders: 1 exercise
-  Biceps: 1 exercise
-  Triceps: 1 exercise

###  :nut_and_bolt: Lower Body
-  Quads: 1-2 exercises
-  Hamstrings: 1-2 exercises
-  Glutes: 0-1 exercise
-  Calves: 1-2 exercises
