##  :beginner: About
Quick disclaimer: I am not a personal trainer 
But with so much information on working out, I found it overwhelming to understand what I wanted to get out of working out and what exercises matters to me. 

## :zap: Why working out? 
I think the first important step I took was asking myself why I wanted to work out and I came up with the following: 
- Run Faster & Jump Higher to be able to make cool plays in Ultimate Frisbee
- Build strength to prevent injuries
- Build good health habits before I reach old age
- 
By laying out my motivations, it helped me identify what the reasons were for working out and establish the overall big picture that would lead to my workout routine

##  :wrench: Routine
The next step I took was to identify how working out was going to fit into my life. How often was I determined to work out for? Where would I fit it in my calendar? I found it helpful to establish a weekly routine: 

| Day       | Activity        |
|-----------|------------------|
| Monday    | Upper Body                  |
| Tuesday   | Frisbee / Cardio                 |
| Wednesday | Abs                 |
| Thursday  | Lower Body                 |
| Friday    | Recovery Day                 |
| Saturday  | Frisbee / Cardio                 |
| Sunday    | Floater                 |

I think it's okay to deviate from the plan if life moments happen but establishing this routine gave me a general idea of how often I was willing to dedicate to working out. What also helped was adding a "Floater" Day in case I needed to shift my week due to an event. 

##  :wrench: Equipment
Next step was understanding what workout equipment I had available: Home equipment? Gym? Free weights? 
I decided to get a gym membership close to my work so I could go there after work and avoid the post-work traffic. 

##  :wrench: Workout
Once I established my time and equipment, I wanted to understand how I would structure my workouts. I decided to set two gym days: 1 for Upper Body and 1 for Lower Body. Then the Abs and Cardio days I can do at home or outside the gym. 

### :notebook: Upper Body

-  Chest: 2 exercises
-  Back: 2 exercises
-  Shoulders: 1 exercise

###  :nut_and_bolt: Lower Body
