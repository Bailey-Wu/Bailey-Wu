##  :beginner: About
Disclaimer: I want to clarify that I am not a personal trainer. With the vast amount of information available on workout regimes, I often felt overwhelmed trying to determine my fitness goals and which exercises would be most beneficial for me. This is why I decided to create a personalized space to share my own experiences and insights, as they may resonate with others navigating similar challenges.

## :zap: Why working out? 
The first important step I took was reflecting on my motivations for working out. I identified my main reasons for my fitness journey:
-  To run faster and jump higher, enabling me to compete at higher levels of Ultimate Frisbee
-  To build strength and reduce the risk of injuries
-  To cultivate healthy habits that will benefit me as I age

By clearly outlining my motivations, I was able to understand the underlying reasons for my workouts and create a comprehensive vision that would guide my fitness routine.
Here is a simple flow chart:

##  :wrench: Routine
The next step I took was to identify how working out was going to fit into my life. How often was I determined to work out for? Where would I fit it in my calendar? I found it helpful to establish a weekly routine: 

| Day       | Activity        |
|-----------|------------------|
| Monday    | Upper Body                  |
| Tuesday   | Frisbee / Cardio                 |
| Wednesday | Abs                 |
| Thursday  | Lower Body                 |
| Friday    | Recovery Day                 |
| Saturday  | Frisbee / Cardio                 |
| Sunday    | Floater                 |

I think it's okay to deviate from the plan if life moments happen but establishing this routine gave me a general idea of how often I was willing to dedicate to working out. What also helped was adding a "Floater" Day in case I needed to shift my week due to an event. 

##  :wrench: Equipment
Next step was understanding what workout equipment I had available: Home equipment? Gym? Free weights? 
I decided to get a gym membership close to my work so I could go there after work and avoid the post-work traffic. 

##  :wrench: Workout
Once I established my time and equipment, I wanted to understand how I would structure my workouts. I decided to set two gym days: 1 for Upper Body and 1 for Lower Body. Then the Abs and Cardio days I can do at home or outside the gym.
